    <header><h1>Favorite movie</h1>
    <h2>Fast and Furious</h2>
</header>
<main>Fast & Furious is the movie which I have watched recently I really liked it as the movie shows 
    about honesty with family and is all about racing. The movie revolves around the main character 
    Dom and his crew who take up challenges and new experiences to deal with street car racing and 
    his fans treat him like a star. It is a story about family, loyalty, redemption, and the consequences of actions.
